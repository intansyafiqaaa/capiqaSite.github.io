						Hi! My name is Intan Syafiqahanum binti Burhanudin, better known as Intan or Apiq :D  I am 20 years old and a diploma student in a computer science course at UiTM Arau. I am the 4th child of 6 siblings. I love myself because I am confident in myself, I love and dare to try new things so I have experience in many things. I have a lot of dreams and I hope I can achieve what I dream of. My ambition is to be an educator who is able to impart knowledge and understanding to the next generation who will lead the country in a better direction and be able to be a useful human being. Honestly, before this I wanted to be a doctor or sportsman because I was very interested in sports science subjects but destiny has changed my ambition to become an instructor or anything related to information technology. At first, I found it difficult to accept a course that I was not interested in but after getting the first semester test results, I realized and awakened myself to try to learn and accept a computer science course. This is because if I donâ€™t accept this computer science course in myself, I will continue to fail the test. Alhamdulillah, after motivating myself and resurrecting myself I was able to take and accept this course and started to be interested in computer science but I still keep my sports science knowledge and not wasted. I am so thankful that I have the attitude of being able to awaken myself without relying on people to make me realize that tomorrow is still there. Last but not least, I stick to the phrase "You are the author of your life story, don't let anyone else." which made me confident of being able to be with myself and get up despite repeatedly facing a fall.
							
						<br>
						<br>
							
						May you and all human beings in this world be able to face all the bittersweetness of life that will happen in our lives that we never knew existed.
							
						<br>							
						<br>

						Me and I, <br> Capiqaanum</p>
